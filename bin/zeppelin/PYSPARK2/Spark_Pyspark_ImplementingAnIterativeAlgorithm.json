k-means:\n \n* closestPoint: given a (latitude/longitude) point and an array of current center points, returns the index in the array of the center closest to the given point\n* addPoints: given two points, return a point which is the sum of the two points —that is, (x1+x2, y1+y2)\n* distanceSquared: given two points, returns the squared distance of the two —this is a common calculation required in graph analysis\n* Note that the stub code sets the variable K equal to 5—this is the number of means to calculate.\n* The stub code also sets the variable convergeDist. This will be used to decide when the k-means calculation is done—when the amount the locations of the means changes between iterations is less than convergeDist. \nA “perfect” solution would be 0; this number represents a “good enough” solution.

For each coordinate point, use the provided closestPoint function to map that point to the index in the kPoints array of the location closest to that point.\nThe resulting RDD should be keyed by the index, and the value should be the pair: (point, 1). (The value 1 will later be used to count the number of points closest to a given mean.)\nFor example:\n```\n(1, ((37.43210, -121.48502), 1))\n(4, ((33.11310, -111.33201), 1))\n(0, ((39.36351, -119.40003), 1))\n(1, ((40.00019, -116.44829), 1))\n...\n```\n2. Reduce the result: for each center in the kPoints array, sum the latitudes and longitudes, respectively, of all the points closest to that center, and also find the number of closest points.\nFor example:\n```\n(0, ((2638919.87653,-8895032.182481), 74693)))\n(1, ((3654635.24961,-12197518.55688), 101268)))\n(2, ((1863384.99784,-5839621.052003), 48620)))\n(3, ((4887181.82600,-14674125.94873), 126114)))\n(4, ((2866039.85637,-9608816.13682), 81162)))\n```\n\n3. The reduced RDD should have (at most) K members. Map each to a new center point by calculating the average latitude and longitude for each set of closest points: that is, map (index,(totalX,totalY),n) to (index,(totalX/ n, totalY/n)).\n4. Collect these new points into a local map or array keyed by index.\n5. Use the provided distanceSquared method to calculate how much the centers “moved” between the current iteration and the last. That is, for each center in kPoints, calculate the distance between that point and the corresponding new point, and sum those distances. That sum is the delta between iterations; when the delta is less than convergeDist, stop iterating.\n6.
