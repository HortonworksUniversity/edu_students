SETUP TLS FOR THE AMBARI SERVER
Note: This installs a package called expect. This is an old way of interacting with a shell wizard. We need to hunt down the command line parameters and update this script.
1. On the Ambari node change directory to the ambari-server

	% cd ~/sbin/tls/ambari-server

2. Run the script to setup ambari with https and with a truststore.

	% ./setup-ambari-tls.sh

3. Validate the use of https

	https://admin01.cloudair.lan:8443

4. You can edit the Desktop shortcut for Ambari. It is located on the remote desktop in Desktop. 

SETUP TRUSTSTORE FOR THE AMBARI SERVER
