This is a reoccuring problem. Here is how I fix it
Hortonworks Docs

# Remove ats-hbase before swtiching between clusters
# This is for unsecured, if you are running Kerberos you will need kinit

su - yarn-ats
yarn app -destroy ats-hbase
hdfs dfs -rm -r -skipTrash ./3.1.0.0-78/*  # stack version
exit

su - hdfs
hdfs dfs -rm -r -skipTrash /services/sync/yarn-ats/hbase.yarnfile

# And you may have to remove the zookeeper file

zookeeper-client 
ls /
rmr /atsv2-hbase-unsecure
quit

# Restart
Ambari > Yarn > stop 
Ambari > Yarn > start
