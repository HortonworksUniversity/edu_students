Ambari Metric Collector Fails to Connect

The following steps would help you in cleaning up Ambari Metrics System data in a given cluster.

Important Note:
Cleaning up the AMS data would remove all the historical AMS data available. The hbase parameters mentioned above are specific to AMS and they are different from the Cluster Hbase parameters

Using Ambari
1. Set AMS to maintenance
2. Stop AMS from Ambari
3. Identify the following from the AMS Configs screen
	'Metrics Service operation mode' (embedded or distributed)
	hbase.rootdir
	hbase.zookeeper.property.dataDir
AMS data would be stored in 'hbase.rootdir' identified above. 
4. Backup and remove the AMS data.
	cd /var/lib/ambari-metrics-collector
	tar cvf /tmp/ambarimetrics.tar .
5. If the Metrics Service operation mode is 'embedded', then the data is stored in OS files. Use regular OS commands to backup and remove the files in hbase.rootdir.
         sudo rm -r /var/lib/ambari-metrics-collector/hbase/*
6. If the Metrics Service is 'distributed', then the data is stored in HDFS. Use 'hdfs dfs' commands to backup and remove the files in hbase.rootdir.
	sudo su - hdfs
	hdfs dfs -rm /???
6. Remove the AMS zookeeper data by backing up and removing the contents of 'hbase.tmp.dir'/zookeeper
	sudo rm -r /var/lib/ambari-metrcis-collector/hbase.tmp.dir/zookeeper/*
7. Remove any Phoenix spool files from 'hbase.tmp.dir'/phoenix-spool folder
	sudo rm -r /var/lib/ambari-metrics-collector/hbase-tmp/phoenix-spool/*
8. Restart AMS using Ambari
